# Database description
We are creating a database system that helps manage data of world hunger using SQL and Java. So basically creating a system where it keeps track of people 
that are suffering from starvation in-country and then allocating resources according to that i.e more the number more resources go their way.

We will have multiple tables where we store information such as Population that is starving, countries GDP, Total population, etc. Then we can 
create another table that will keep track of the resources such as food packages, water supply, necessities for living, etc. Then we use this information 
to allocate more resources to the countries that need it more based on the amount of population that is in need of food and water. This way we will be 
able to help every country in the amounts they require the resources. This will prevent waste of resources too.

Multiple strong entities in the database such as country names and Providing country names.
